    // singly linked list of nodes which start earlier than this one and extend past its start,
    // which we call an 'overextension'. The list is ordered from last endpoint to earliest
    // endpoint. We ignore OOB since we assume anything which overlaps is all part of the same
    // underlying resource and has the same OOB end.
    //
    // the root node owns all the children (this is not shared with any other list or the nodes in
    // the parent list)
    //
    // usually only the head of this list is used, because we don't aim to find the best fit when
    // using this list - we just fall back to the one with the latest endpoint which is the first in
    // the list. the list is primarily needed to manage things with insertions/deletions if there
    // are multiple levels of overextension
    //
    // This list is only used to find the real resource for an address which is past a given node
    // when our naive search for an address finds a too-small resource immediately preceeding that
    // address. For each resource we only add to lists of others that start > our start (because if
    // they start equal to us, the sorting-by-size will naturally find the right one) and only to
    // ranges where our start is past their end. This is specifically to counteract the fact that we
    // may extend past them and not otherwise be found with a normal search.
    //
    // Note: for lookups we would only need the ranges that end past our end (as we will never use
    // nodes in the list where they end before us, as either the address is found in our range or it
    // will be out of their reach too. However we include them in our list because if a node is
    // added after us then that node may need to know about them and we want to limit how much
    // iteration is needed when adding a new node to collect its overextensions.
    //
    // As an example:
    //
    // A 0x100 -> 0x10000
    // B 0x100 -> 0x150
    // C 0x200 -> 0x300
    // D 0x300 -> 0x400
    // E 0x350 -> 0x360
    //
    // Regardless of the order these are added in, they will have these lists:
    //
    // A - NULL      if we find node A there is nothing else that could be found after it. In
    //               practice with this setup we would only find A when searching for an address
    //               0x100-0x1ff and A will be after B in the list since it has a larger endpoint.
    // B - A         if we find node B anything after it would be in A. In practice, this will not
    //               happen A will be sorted after B and will never be found for any address.
    // C - A         if we find node C anything after it would be in A. In practice, this will never
    //               happen as any address after C will be found in D as they are adjacent
    // D - A         similar to the above, but in this case an address could exist after it such as
    //               0x500
    // E - A->C      the end result is the same as D's list, but if A were deleted we would be
    //               able to now find D for queries after the end of E
